# How to make a change in {{NAME}}

This is the short version of the AI-native SDLC as it runs here. The detail
lives in [`intents/README.md`](intents/README.md) (types, gates, who edits
what), [`REVIEW-POLICY.md`](REVIEW-POLICY.md) (tiers, review passes) and
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) → "Parallel sessions". If this file and those
disagree, they win.

Every change follows the same path, and its **type** decides how much of it
you do. Work from a Claude Code session started in the main checkout
(`{{PATH}}`). That session is the **coordinator**, and it is where
`CLAUDE.md`, the skills and the hooks load. The id is the next `§` number,
which `npm run queue -- --next-id` prints.

## The steps

**1. Intent: what you want and why**

- Run `/intent` and describe the problem in your own words.
- It creates `intents/<id>-<slug>/` with `intent.md` and `metadata.yml`, and
  proposes a type. When in doubt, the type is feature.
- Read it. If it's right, record `intent_accepted: <date>`, or ask Claude to
  record it ("accept §N's intent"). This is gate 1, and it is your decision.

**2. Spec (features only)**

- Run `/spec <id>`; `spec.md` says what will be built.
- You record `spec_accepted`.

**3. Plan: how it will be built**

- Run `/build-plan <id>`; `plan.md` lists the files, the tests and the steps.
- `plan_approved` is your decision; you or the agent you ask records it. No
  code before this gate: `check:intent` fails a change whose code came
  first.

**4. Build**, in one of two ways:

- **Directly:** the coordinator creates the branch
  `feat|fix|refactor|adjust|exp/<id>-<slug>` in a worktree, and the
  `{{NAME}}-implementer` agent works through the plan, tests first.
- **In parallel:** `npm run spawn -- <id>` creates a worktree at
  `../{{NAME}}-wt/<id>-<slug>` with a reserved port 5200+(id mod 100) and a
  `CLAUDE.local.md` brief. When the gate the type needs is recorded
  (`plan_approved`, or `intent_accepted` for an adjustment or experiment),
  `/spawn` also launches the implementer in the background there, and
  reports back with an offer of `/review`. Otherwise open `claude` in the
  worktree; that session implements. Keep it to about three at once.

Either way, the build ends with `npm run verify` green and
`status: in-review`.

**5. Review**

Run `/review` from the coordinator. It runs `npm run verify`,
`npm run check:intent` and the passes in `REVIEW-POLICY.md`, then writes
`review.md` with a verdict:

- **rework**: fix, then run `/review` again;
- **attest** or **escalate**: go to step 6.

The report also says `live-check: owed` or `not-needed`. It is owed for
changes to the runtime paths `REVIEW-POLICY.md` → "Live checks" names, to
`.claude/settings.json`, and for anything else only a live run can show.
When owed, its `## Live check` section gives the steps. Run them yourself,
then record `live_checked: <date>`, or tell Claude you ran them and ask it
to record the date. If you find a defect, leave the date empty and send the
change back to rework. `check:intent` blocks the merge until the date is
there.

Commit `review.md` and the `live_checked:` date to the branch before the
merge: the merge check reads the branch from git and can't see uncommitted
files.

**6. Approve and merge (your gate)**

- **Automated tier** (only intents or docs touched): merge.
- **Attested tier** (`src/`, scripts, tests): read the report, then merge.
- **Reviewed tier** (this policy, the kit's checker, agents, skills,
  `.claude/settings.json`, and anything that handles prompts, user-facing
  output, credentials or personal data): read the report **and** the diff,
  then merge.

Merging goes in this order:
1. `git merge --no-ff` on `main`;
2. `npm run verify` on `main`;
3. set `merged:` and `status: done` in `metadata.yml`;
4. push, if the repository has a remote;
5. `npm run spawn -- <id> --remove`, if you used a worktree.

You can ask Claude to do the merge, the push or the removal, each only when
you ask for it, for that change, in the current conversation. `/ship <id>`
does all of it in order and stops at the first step that fails
(`/ship <id> --dry-run`, or "can §N ship?", only reports). If you ran the
live check, say so in the same message. Run it from the main checkout, on
`main`. It first checks that nothing but the review and the metadata changed
after the reviewed commit, that `check:intent` passes, and that any owed
live check is recorded, and refuses if not
(`REVIEW-POLICY.md` → "Merging").

## Running the steps on their own: `/auto`

`/auto <id>` in the coordinator carries one accepted intent through steps 2
to 5 without a prompt between them, and ends at step 6's door:

- **Your message is a request to record one gate.** `/auto <id>` is your
  request to record that intent's `plan_approved` (as `by-agent`, with a
  comment naming it). `spec_accepted`, `live_checked` and `/ship` stay yours.
- **A feature stops once, at the spec**, for your `spec_accepted`; a yes
  continues the run. A fix or refactor has no spec; an adjustment or
  experiment has no plan.
- **It builds and reviews.** It spawns the worktree, launches the
  implementer, runs `/review`, and re-runs the reviewer's commands and
  surviving mutants itself before it writes `review.md`. A finding marked
  "Needs rework:" (mechanical) goes back to the implementer; one marked
  "Needs decision:" stops the run. At most three review rounds, counting
  rounds after a failed live check.
- **It stops** for your questions, a decision, an `escalate` verdict (you
  read the diff; your next `/auto <id>` goes on to the live check or the
  ship, with no new round), a spec or plan amendment, running out of rounds,
  a live check owed, a CRITICAL finding, a red it cannot trace, a mismatch
  in the re-check, a plan that exists unapproved, a blocked ship dry-run, an
  agent error, a worktree held by another session, or a
  fourth open session. Each stop writes `auto_round` and
  `auto_stopped` into `metadata.yml`, shows in `npm run sessions` and
  `npm run queue` as `auto · r<n> · <reason>`, and sends a push notification
  when the session has the tool.
- **It ends at "ready: `/ship <id>`"**, after `npm run ship -- <id>
  --dry-run` shows nothing in the way, and never ships. Closing the session
  pauses it; `/auto <id>` in a new one resumes from the recorded round.
- Reviews of auto runs say `run: auto`, and every third attested one is
  sampled (every fifth manual one).

## What each type requires

| Type | Use for | You record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| feature | new behaviour, a new integration, anything with a design question | intent, spec, plan |
| fix | a live defect; needs a test that fails first, and `follows_up: <id>` if an earlier § caused it | intent, plan |
| refactor | structure changes, behaviour held constant | intent, plan |
| adjustment | wording, README, config, constants: at most 5 files and 60 lines, no core code | intent only |
| experiment | throwaway probes; never merged into core code as-is | intent only |

## Along the way

- `npm run queue` lists every intent by status, generated from the
  `metadata.yml` files.
- `npm run sessions` shows every worktree: status, gates, ahead/behind
  `main`, uncommitted files, and whether its session is working, idle or
  needs you.
- `/grid` refreshes `docs/sdlc-grid.md`. Run it every few weeks.
- A defect you hit becomes a new **fix** intent. Triaging it is one of your
  gates too.
- Every fifth attested manual change, and every third attested auto-run
  change, gets a full diff read after merge (`sampled: yes` in its
  `review.md`).

To start: `/intent` plus what you want changed. The first one is §1, the
stack and skeleton.
