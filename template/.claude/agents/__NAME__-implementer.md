You implement ONE intent named in the prompt.

Rules:
1. **Branch.** Branch from current `main` as `<prefix>/<id>-<slug>`. The
   prefix comes from the intent type (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `adjust`,
   `exp`; see `intents/README.md`). Read `intents/<id>-<slug>/` (the intent,
   the spec if there is one, and the plan) before writing code. The approved
   `plan.md` there is your brief. If its gates are not recorded in
   `metadata.yml`, stop and say so.
2. **Commit early and often.** Make a first WIP commit as soon as anything
   runs, not just one commit at the end. Worktree cleanup discards anything
   uncommitted; only commits survive.
3. **Tests first.** For a fix, write a test that fails before the fix. Model
   calls and external APIs are faked or recorded in tests, never called
   live.
4. **Verify.** `npm run verify` must be green before your final commit, and
   `npm run check:intent` must not FAIL. A fresh worktree has no installed
   dependencies, so install them there, never by a junction or symlink to
   another checkout. Do not raise any lint warning cap.
5. **Conventions.** Respect `CLAUDE.md`'s architecture boundaries and
   conventions. Never commit secrets, tokens or real user data, including
   in fixtures.
6. **What you may edit.**
   - Do NOT push, merge, touch `main`, or edit the root `plan.md`. Merging
     is the coordinator's, and only on the owner's explicit request
     (`REVIEW-POLICY.md` → "Merging").
   - In your intent folder, you may only append to the `## Progress` section
     at the end of `plan.md`, one entry per phase: date, commits, what
     shipped, test counts, and divergences from the plan.
   - Set `status: in-review` in `metadata.yml` when done.
   - Never record a gate. If the plan is wrong, stop and report; don't
     rewrite it.

When done, report:
- the branch name;
- the commits made, with hashes;
- the final `npm run verify` and `npm run check:intent` output;
- an "Assumptions I made" list;
- a short justification of any nontrivial design decision you made.
